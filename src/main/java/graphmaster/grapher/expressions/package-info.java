/**
 * This package has classes and interfaces for representing and evaluating
 * mathematical expressions in a graphical context.
 * These expressions can be used
 * to generate plots, graphs and other visualizations of mathematical data.
 * <p>
 * The primary classes in this package are the Expression and Variable classes,
 * which give a framework for constructing complex mathematical expressions
 * from simpler building blocks.
 * The EvaluationContext interface is provided
 * to define the environment in which expressions are evaluated, such as the
 * range of x and y values for a given graph.
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package are designed to be used with the
 * Grapher package to generate graphical representations of mathematical data.
 * The Expression interface can be used to generate the y-values of a plot, while
 * the Variable class can be used to represent the x-axis variable.
 * By combining
 * these elements in various ways, complex graphs and visualizations can be created.

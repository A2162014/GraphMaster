/**
 * The expression package provides classes for creating and manipulating mathematical expressions.
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package define various types of expressions,
 * such as numbers, variables, functions and operations.
 * These expressions can be combined and evaluated to compute complex mathematical functions.
 * <p>
 * The following classes are included in this package:
 * <p>Product: Represents the product of two or more expressions.
 * <p>Sum: Represents the sum of two or more expressions.
 * <p>Binary: Represents a binary operation, such as addition or multiplication, on two expressions.
 * <p>Number: Represents a numeric constant.
 * <p>Cosine: Represents the cosine of an expression.
 * <p>Unary: Represents a unary operation, such as negation or absolute value, on an expression.
 * <p>Ceiling: Represents the smallest integer greater than or equal to an expression.
 * <p>AbsoluteValue: Represents the absolute value of an expression.
 * <p>Cotangent: Represents the cotangent of an expression.
 * <p>Quantity: Represents a quantity with a value and units.
 * <p>Modulo: Represents the rest of the division of two expressions.
 * <p>Cosecant: Represents the cosecant of an expression.
 * <p>Power Represents an expression raised to a power.
 * <p>SquareRoot: Represents the square root of an expression.
 * <p>Quotient: Represents the quotient of two expressions.
 * <p>Sine: Represents the sine of an expression.
 * <p>Secant: Represents the secant of an expression.
 * <p>Log: Represents the logarithm of an expression.
 * <p>Floor: Represents the largest integer less than or equal to an expression.
 * <p>NthRoot: Represents the nth root of an expression.
 * <p>Function: Represents a mathematical function.
 * <p>Difference: Represents the difference of two expressions.
 * <p>Variable: Represents a variable.
 * <p>Tangent: Represents the tangent of an expression.

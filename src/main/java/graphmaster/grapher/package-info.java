/**
 * The grapher package provides classes for creating and manipulating graphs.
 * <p>
 * The main class in this package is the Graph class, which represents a graph
 * as a collection of nodes and edges.
 * Other classes in the package give
 * capability for traversing graphs, computing the shortest paths and more.
 * <p>
 * All classes in this package use the standard Java Collections framework,
 * so familiarity with that framework is recommended.
 * Also, some classes
 * use third-party libraries such as JGraphT for advanced graph algorithms.

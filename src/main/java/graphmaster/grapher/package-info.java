/**
 * The grapher package provides classes for visualizing mathematical expressions and functions.
 * <p>The classes in this package define a graphical user interface for displaying graphs of mathematical functions,
 * as well as a parser for converting text input expression objects that can be evaluated and graphed.
 * <p>The following classes are included in this package:
 * <p>expressions package: Provides classes for creating and manipulating mathematical expressions.
 * <p>parser package: Provides classes for parsing mathematical expressions from text input.
 * <p>Window: Represents the main window of the app, which displays the graph and user interface controls.
 * <p>The parser and expressions packages are used to create expression objects from text input, which are then
 * evaluated and displayed in the graph window.
 * <p>The window provides controls for adjusting the appearance of the graph, such as
 * the range of the x and y axes, the color and style of the plot and the type of function being graphed.

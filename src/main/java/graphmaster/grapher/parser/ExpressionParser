The code provided is a Java implementation of a parser for a mathematical expression. The parser is capable of handling
basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, as well as
several mathematical functions, such as sine, cosine, and square root. The code consists of two parts, with the first
part containing the main method that takes an input string and returns the parsed expression as a Quantity object. The
second part of the code contains several helper methods used to parse and manipulate the input string.

The first part of the code is the main method parseExpression, which takes a string input as a parameter and returns a
Quantity object representing the parsed expression. The method first initializes a TokenString object by parsing the
input string using the parseTokens method. The parseTokens method splits the input string into individual tokens, which
are then added to the TokenString object. The method then calls the doOrderOfOperations method, which recursively
applies the order of operations to the TokenString object until it is fully evaluated. The final result is then returned
 as a Quantity object.

The second part of the code contains several helper methods used by the parseExpression method to parse and manipulate
the input string. These methods include parseFunctionParams, getFunctionParamsEnd, scanFromRight, and
substituteUnaryMinus.

The parseFunctionParams method parses the function parameters of a specified type from a token string. It takes a
TokenString object and a TokenType object as parameters and returns a Quantity object representing the parsed
parameters. The method splits the token string into individual parameter strings using commas as a delimiter and then
recursively applies the doOrderOfOperations method to each parameter string.

The getFunctionParamsEnd method finds the index of the closing parentheses of the function parameters given the starting
index of the opening parentheses. It takes a TokenString object and an integer as parameters and returns an integer
representing the index of the closing parentheses.

The scanFromRight method scans the token string from right to left and finds the index of the given token type or any
function token type, taking into account any nested parentheses. It takes a TokenString object and a TokenType object as
 parameters and returns an integer representing the index of the token.

The substituteUnaryMinus method replaces unary minus symbols with equal expressions. It takes a TokenString object as a
parameter and modifies the token string in place by replacing any unary minus symbols with the equivalent expression.

Overall, the code is well-organized and follows standard Java coding conventions. The use of helper methods helps to
simplify the main parsing logic and makes the code more readable and maintainable.

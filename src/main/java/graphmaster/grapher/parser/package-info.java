/**
 * The `graphmaster.grapher.parser`
 * package provides classes for parsing and interpreting graph data from various formats.
 * <p>
 * The main entry point for parsing a graph is the `GraphParser` class,
 * which provides methods for reading a graph in a supported format
 * (for example, GraphML or GML) and returning a `Graph`
 * object that can be used for further processing or visualization.
 * <p>
 * This package includes several utility classes for parsing and handling graph data,
 * including `GraphParseException`
 * for
 * handling parse errors and `GraphReader` for reading graph data from a file or input stream.
 * <p>
 * Note that the classes in this package are designed to be extensible and customizable,
 * and can be subclassed or used as a starting
 * point for implementing new graph parsing capability.

This is Java code for a GUI application that displays a graph of a mathematical function. The graph is drawn using
Java's AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing libraries.

The main class in this code is Window, which extends the JPanel class and implements several interfaces
(MouseWheelListener, KeyListener, and Runnable).

The Window class has several instance variables, including buff and g2d (a buffered image and graphics context for
drawing), parser and function (an expression parser and the function to graph), windowX, windowY, windowWidth, and
windowHeight (window properties), mousePt (the current mouse position), textBox (the input field for mathematical
expressions), and yVar and zVar (time variables).

The Window class has several methods, including updateDT() (which updates the time variables), paintComponent()
(which paints the graph), isaBoolean() (which checks if a given KeyEvent represents a valid character for a boolean
expression), and the constructor (which sets up the GUI and initializes the instance variables).

The paintComponent() method first clears the screen, then evaluates the function and plots the points, and finally draws
 the x-axis, y-axis, function equation, and image. It also converts point lists to arrays, and draws the graph.

The code also includes two inner classes, MyMouseAdapter and MyMouseMotionAdapter, which handle mouse events.

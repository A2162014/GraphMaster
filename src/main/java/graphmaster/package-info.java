/**
 * The GraphMaster package provides classes for working with graphs and networks.
 * A graph is a mathematical structure that consists of a set of vertices (nodes),
 * and a set of edges that connect them.
 * This package includes implementations of
 * various types of graphs, as well as algorithms for working with graphs, such as
 * shortest path algorithms, connectivity algorithms and graph traversal algorithms.
 * <p>
 * All classes within this package are designed to be thread-safe and performant, with
 * a focus on ease-of-use and flexibility.
 * The package includes interfaces that custom graph classes can implement *,
 * as well as concrete implementations that can
 * be used out-of-the-box.
 * <p>
 * The package is part of the GraphMaster project, which aims to give a comprehensive
 * set of tools for working with graphs in Java.
 * For more information about the project
 * and how to contribute, please the see the project's GitHub repository.
